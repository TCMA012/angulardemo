Using content projection for component reusability and less code duplication

This question made me think about components that share bits and pieces. For instance, similar types of "cards" that all have a title. They would all need an @Input() title: string;. And you would have to write it again whenever you add a new type of card to the codebase.

The idea is to write a card-title component with the Input, and then project it into the different types of cards. That way you only write the Input logic once.

I have written an example here, with three types of cards: a basic text one, a "profile" one with a pic, and a "selectable" one with an Output. Plus the little "card title" component with the Input.
