A nested form is a component that comprises part of a form. A common example is an address component that contains separate fields for street, city, postcode etc. The motivation for having a nested form is similar to that of a Custom Form Component - to group related behaviour, for ease of re-use etc.

There are two kinds of nested form components that Kara talks about.

    Composite ControlValueAccessor Component: A ControlValueAccessor component which contains an arbitrary number of form controls instead of just one.
    Sub Form Component: A Component that contains a form fragment but does not implement the ControlValueAccessor interface.
